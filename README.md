##  Aim

To test and compare how different pattern models respond to various types of prompts — **broad or unstructured (naïve)** versus **clear and refined (basic)** — across multiple scenarios.  
The objective is to analyze the **quality**, **accuracy**, and **depth** of the generated responses and identify how prompt clarity affects AI performance.

---

##  AI Tools Required

- **ChatGPT (tested using GPT-5 model)**  
- **Any text editor or spreadsheet** (for organizing and recording outputs)

---

##  Explanation

### 1. Defining the Two Prompt Types

Before performing the experiment, two categories of prompts were defined:

| Prompt Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Naïve Prompt** | A broad, vague, or unstructured request with little guidance. Often lacks context and may lead to generic or incomplete responses. |
| **Basic Prompt** | A clear, detailed, and structured request with specific instructions or contextual information that guides the model toward a more accurate and useful response. |

---

### 2. Writing and Refining Prompts

Each **naïve prompt** was paired with a **refined basic prompt** targeting the same scenario.  
The basic prompts were designed using **structured prompt engineering techniques**, ensuring clear intent and expected output.

---

### 3. Test Scenarios

Multiple real-world scenarios were chosen to evaluate how ChatGPT (GPT-5) performs under different prompt styles:

1. **Creative Story Generation**  
2. **Factual Question Answering**  
3. **Concept Summarization**  
4. **Advice or Recommendation Generation**  
5. **Optional Analytical or Explanation-Based Task**

---

### 4. Experiment Execution Steps

1. **Input the naïve prompt** for each selected scenario and record ChatGPT’s response.  
2. **Input the basic prompt** for the same scenario and capture the corresponding response.  
3. **Compare both outputs** based on:  
   - **Quality** (clarity, organization, usefulness)  
   - **Accuracy** (correctness and factual consistency)  
   - **Depth** (completeness, examples, multi-dimensional explanations)  
4. **Document findings** in a structured comparison table.  
5. **Summarize results** to derive best practices for prompt engineering.

##  Output

###  Definition of Prompt Types

- **Naïve Prompt:** A broad, vague, or unstructured request with little guidance.  
- **Basic Prompt:** A clear, detailed, and structured request with explicit instructions.

###  Comparative Table of Prompts and Responses

| Scenario | Naïve Prompt | Basic Prompt | Observation |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Creative Story Generation** | “Write a story.” | “Write a 200-word story about a robot who learns human emotions and ends with a moral.” | The basic prompt produced a well-structured, emotionally engaging story with a clear moral. The naïve prompt gave a short, random story with no direction. |
| **Factual Question** | “Tell me about climate change.” | “Explain climate change in 5 sentences, covering causes, effects, and possible solutions.” | The basic prompt offered concise, factually correct information, while the naïve one provided general and repetitive statements. |
| **Concept Summarization** | “Summarize AI.” | “Summarize Artificial Intelligence in 3 bullet points highlighting its definition, key applications, and challenges.” | The basic prompt yielded a neat, clear summary. The naïve prompt was too long and lacked focus. |
| **Recommendation Task** | “Give career advice.” | “Give career advice for an Electronics Engineering student aspiring to enter the Robotics industry.” | The basic prompt produced practical and specific suggestions; the naïve prompt was too generic to be useful. |

##  Analysis

### 1. Quality
- **Basic prompts** consistently generated structured, clear, and detailed outputs.  
- **Naïve prompts** were vague, repetitive, and lacked focus.

### 2. Accuracy
- **Basic prompts** showed fewer factual errors and covered all key aspects of the question.  
- **Naïve prompts** often missed essential points or provided oversimplified information.

### 3. Depth
- **Structured prompts** produced layered responses including definitions, examples, and implications.  
- **Naïve prompts** tended to be surface-level and lacked explanatory richness.

### 4. Exceptions
- In **creative/open-ended tasks**, naïve prompts sometimes led to imaginative or unexpected results.  
- However, they still lacked logical flow and meaningful conclusions compared to refined prompts.

##  Summary of Findings

1. **Prompt clarity directly impacts response quality.**  
   The more structured and context-rich a prompt is, the better the model’s understanding and accuracy.

2. **Naïve prompts** can be useful for **open creativity** but often lead to shallow or incomplete responses.

3. **Basic prompts** deliver:
   - Higher factual accuracy  
   - Better organization and readability  
   - Greater depth and relevance  

4. **Prompt refinement** is crucial for obtaining consistent, high-quality AI outputs.

5. **Best Practice:**  
   Always provide explicit instructions, contextual details, and desired format or scope when prompting ChatGPT or similar AI tools.

##  Result

The experiment was **executed successfully**.
